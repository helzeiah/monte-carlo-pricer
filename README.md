# Monte Carlo Option Pricer

A high-performance C++ library and CLI tool for pricing European
put/call options via Monte Carlo Simulation.

### -WIP-

Right now this tool supports Monte-Carlo Simulation for pricing European options.
In the future I plan to add additional pricing engines such as Black-Scholes,
and Binomial Trees, as well as advanced option types such as American, Asian, Barrier,
etc.
